# Financial Risk for Loan Approval

## Overview

Lending institutions require effective credit scoring models to assess borrower risk and minimize loan defaults. This project applies machine learning techniques to predict loan defaults based on borrower data. By leveraging classification models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, we aim to provide accurate and timely predictions to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions. The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 92.33%, identifying key risk factors like debt-to-income ratio and net worth to minimize loan default risks.

### Problem Statement

Lending institutions face the challenge of evaluating borrower risk to avoid loan defaults. Traditional credit scoring models may not always be reliable, especially for borrowers with limited credit history. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based solution to predict loan defaults using personal and financial data, enabling lenders to make informed decisions and reduce the risk of loan defaults.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of 20,000 records of personal and financial data, including columns such as:

- Demographic information (e.g., age, education level, marital status)
- Financial data (e.g., credit score, debt-to-income ratio, loan amount)
- Loan application data (e.g., loan duration, previous loan defaults)

#### Columns in the Dataset:
- **ApplicationDate:** The date the loan application was submitted.
- **Age:** Applicant's age.
- **AnnualIncome:** Applicant's yearly income.
- **CreditScore:** Creditworthiness score.
- **EmploymentStatus:** Employment status of the applicant (e.g., employed, self-employed, unemployed).
- **EducationLevel:** Highest level of education attained.
- **Experience:** Applicant's years of work experience.
- **LoanAmount:** The requested loan amount.
- **LoanDuration:** The duration of the loan in months.
- **MaritalStatus:** Marital status of the applicant (e.g., single, married, divorced).
- **NumberOfDependents:** Number of dependents in the applicant's household.
- **MonthlyDebtPayments:** Monthly debt obligations.
- **CreditCardUtilizationRate:** Credit card usage percentage.
- **DebtToIncomeRatio:** Ratio of the applicantâ€™s debt to income.
- **LoanApproved:** Binary outcome variable indicating whether the loan was approved (1) or denied (0).
- **RiskScore:** A risk assessment score for each applicant.

### Solution Approach

#### Data Preprocessing

- Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values by filling numerical columns with median values and categorical columns with mode.
- Feature Engineering: Created new features such as DebtToIncomeRatio and NetWorth.
- Normalization: Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler for better model performance.
- Categorical Encoding: Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed relationships between key features, such as debt-to-income ratio, credit score, and loan approval status.
- Identified DebtToIncomeRatio and NetWorth as strong predictors of loan approval likelihood.

#### Model Development

- Algorithms Tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and other classifiers.
- Feature Selection: Focused on identifying key predictors, including credit score and debt-to-income ratio.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized the Random Forest model to improve performance.

#### Model Evaluation

- Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 92.33% for loan approval prediction.
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Evaluated model performance using detailed classification metrics.
- ROC-AUC: Assessed the model's ability to distinguish between loan approved and denied classes.

### Key Findings

- Model Performance: Random Forest provided the best performance with an accuracy of 92.33% and strong precision and recall metrics for both loan approval and rejection.
- Feature Insights: Debt-to-income ratio and net worth were critical indicators of loan approval.
- Risk Assessment: The model helps lenders assess financial risk by identifying high-risk applicants based on predictive features.

##### Example Prediction
- Patient Info: Applicant aged 32 with an annual income of $50,000, debt-to-income ratio of 0.35, and a credit score of 720.
- Prediction: The model classified this applicant as likely to have their loan approved (1).
    
### Future Directions

- Integrate alternative data sources (e.g., social media behavior, utility bill payments) for fairer credit assessments.
- Deploy the model as an API to automate credit scoring for lenders.

### Challenges

- Class Imbalance: The dataset contained imbalanced classes, with more loan approvals than denials. This was addressed using oversampling techniques to ensure balanced predictions.
- Feature Selection: Carefully selected features to avoid overfitting and improve model interpretability.

### Future Work

- **Model Improvement**: Try different models such as XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks to improve accuracy.
- **Explainability**: Use SHAP or LIME for model interpretability, making the results more understandable for decision-makers.
- **Deploying the Model**: The final model could be deployed in a real-world system to assist in loan approval processes.
